Good — DNS being verified means you’re past the riskiest bit. What Google is now showing is not an error, it’s a compliance checklist for the App Homepage. You already meet most of it; you just need to make it explicit in the page content.

I’ll map each requirement to what you need to do, then give you a drop-in homepage HTML that will satisfy all of them.

What Google is checking (and how to satisfy each point)
1) “Accurately represent and identify your app or brand”

Action:

The page must clearly say crowHome is the app name.

This must be visible text (not just metadata).

You already have this if:

<title>crowHome</title>
<h1>crowHome</h1>

2) “Fully describe your app’s functionality”

Action:
Add 1–2 short paragraphs explaining what crowHome does, at a high level.

This does not need technical detail — just intent.

3) “Explain with transparency the purpose for which your app requests user data”

Action:
Explicitly say:

what data is accessed (Google Nest device data via SDM)

why (home automation / monitoring)

who uses it (single household)

no third-party sharing

This can be a short paragraph; it does not need to duplicate the privacy policy.

4) “Hosted on a verified domain you own”

You are now compliant:

privacy-notices.github.crowworld.co.uk

Domain verified via Search Console

✅ Nothing further needed here.

5) “Homepage and privacy policy should not be hosted on a third-party platform where you can't verify that you own your subdomain”

This is why they forced domain verification.

Because:

you verified crowworld.co.uk

and the homepage is on a subdomain of it

✅ You are compliant.

(GitHub Pages is fine once domain ownership is proven.)

6) “Include a link to your privacy policy (must match consent screen)”

Action:
Add a visible link to the exact same URL you configured on the consent screen.

7) “Visible to users without requiring login”

GitHub Pages is public.

✅ Already compliant.

The simplest fix: replace index.html with this

This version is purpose-built to pass Google review.
You can copy–paste it verbatim and just adjust URLs if needed.
